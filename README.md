# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using a machine learning model. The project is divided into two main parts: running the Jupyter Notebook to generate model files and using Streamlit to create a web application for sentiment analysis.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Step 1: Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. Place the dataset in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells.
3. After running the notebook, you will get two `.pkl` files.

### Step 2: Start the Streamlit Application

1. Open any code editor and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Streamlit by running the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Step 3: Analyze Text

1. In the Streamlit web application, enter the text you want to analyze in the provided text box.
2. Click on the "Analyze" button.
3. The response will be displayed on the screen and stored in a JSON file in the proper format.
